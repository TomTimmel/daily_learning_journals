##Day 2 CSS Holy Smokes!!!!

##It went well today, although I feel a bit behind on CSS.  I feel like I did learn a lot about CSS today, but I am still learning by making a bunch of mistakes. I look forward to being knowledgeable enough to think more proactively about what my CSS should look like.  Right now I am just adding code as I see a need instead of systematically working through it...Still, progress was made!
