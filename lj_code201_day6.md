##Day 6

##Today was a tough day. I am still having a difficult time with JS. I'm not sure what the disconnect is as I am feeling really confident based upon the readings and lectures...Once we start the labs, I am unable to translate what I have learned and what I'm thinking onto the screen. It's partially syntax and partially just not understanding the steps that JS requires to accomplish a goal.  I don't know the solution, but I am open to ideas.  I'll keep plugging away!
