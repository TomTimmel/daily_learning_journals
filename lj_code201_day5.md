##Day 5

## I thought today was really good. I felt that the lecture time on functions and whiteboard representation was excellent. A better understanding of how JS manages functions and the order things are done really helped.  I liked the lab. I did pretty well, the only help I needed was with the nesting of the functions, I figured out what needed to happen, but I wasn't sure how to do it in JS...
