##Day 3

##Today was a bit tough for me, I'm feeling a little behind. I don't have a great grasp of the structure of code yet.  I understand and feel confident in the concepts when they are taught, or I read about them in the texts.  I'm having difficulty translating it into the actual code.  I think this is in part because the terminology is foreign to me which makes it difficult to communicate internally and externally.  I'm also trying too hard to make my code efficient and simple which is leading to skipping steps in JS and over-complicating CSS.  I'm not feeling too discouraged, just realizing that I my learning curve is going to be steeper than I anticipated.

##Thanks
