#Daily Learning Journal, Day 10 , 8/26/16

##Day 10  The main aspect of today was the group styling project.  The good: it was a fun project to work on and it was great to have the time to spend on CSS in class.  I usually take more time on the JS which puts me behind on my CSS. I learned a lot about css, especially boxes and positioning (much more to learn of course).  The difficult: the 3 person team was a bit tough.  It was a small site to have 3 people working on and the github was still tough for us although we were able to get through it without any major data issues.  

## It was fun for us all to go out for a beer after class, it's important to relax and enjoy each others company outside of the stress of the accelerated pace of class.
