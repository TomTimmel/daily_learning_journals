#Daily Learning Journal, Day 17 , 9/6/16

##Day 17  The final project is going well as we are moving at a good pace and it looks like we will be able to finish on time.  I believe we will also meet most of our stretch goals, time will tell.  The group aspect is going well so far, I occasionally have to bite my tongue when certain things are said, but I'm sure we are all doing that...
