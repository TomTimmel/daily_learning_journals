#Daily Learning Journal, Day 13 , 9/1/16

##Day 13 Today was a good day, I like learning about things like local storage and chart.js.  I am starting to do better at figuring things out for myself, but I still have a long way to go. I'm looking forward to project week as an opportunity to continue that process.  "What will you do with your one wild, and precious life?"
