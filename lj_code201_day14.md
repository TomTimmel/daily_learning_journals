#Daily Learning Journal, Day 14 , 9/2/16

##Day 14  It's exciting to be moving towards our final project. It will be interesting to see how we do without specific instructions about what our website should be/look like.  Not much else to say, kinda' looking forward right now.  I am still not sure if I will take 301, it is really hard to decide whether this is right for me.
