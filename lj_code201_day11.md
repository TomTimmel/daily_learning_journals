#Daily Learning Journal, Day 11 , 8/29/16

##Day 11  I like the new project, it seems like an interesting challenge. I enjoyed being the code review person.  I learned a lot! Boy, it's amazing when you think you have one problem and you spend a huge amount of time on trying to fix it only to realize it was something else. Ugh :)   

##I am still so surprised how some of the simple things that I should know by now are still tripping me up. I'm a bit worried to be honest.
