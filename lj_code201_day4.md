##Day 4

## Today was a good day, I thought the lecture was very well done and I am beginning to understand functions, especially parameters/arguments.  The paired programming was also fun, I think I am starting to understand better the way JS works and what I need to give it.  I'm still a bit behind, in my opinion, in easily understanding what I need to code in JS, but it's getting better...Thanks!
